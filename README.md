# Modelling Crystallisation of Norislk Parent Magma Candidates

This short presentation for the CSIRO Mineral Resources 'Covideo' Series covers some of the melt modelling work conducted *alongside* the research published by [Schoneveld et al. (2020)].

The objective of the modelling was to examine a range of candidates for  parent magmas (taken from proximal basaltic magmatic products), and attempt to determine which may best approximate the source of silicate components of the Norilsk deposit.

The deposit itself provides some key criteria on which to match magmatic candidates, including crystallisation sequences and relative mineral abundances, in addition to silicate mineral chemistry.

While we have some data with which we may be able to match appropriate candidates, there remain a number of geological and geochemical unknowns, alongside processes and complexities which we cannot simply model without many assumptions (e.g. magmatic volatile abundances; some aspects specifically related to mineralisation itself, including assimilation and related fractionation). Here we present what constraints and insights can be gained from forward modelling of these magmatic candidates, and implications for the formation of the Norilsk deposit.
